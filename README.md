**Counter Strike : Round Winner Predictor**
CS:GO is a tactical shooter, where two teams (CT and Terrorist) play for a best of 30 rounds, with each round being 1 minute and 55 seconds. There are 5 players on each team (10 in total) and the first team to reach 16 rounds wins the game. At the start, one team plays as CT and the other as Terrorist. After 15 rounds played, the teams swap side. There are 7 different maps a game can be played on. You win a round as Terrorist by either planting the bomb and making sure it explodes, or by eliminating the other team. You win a round as CT by either eliminating the other team, or by disarming the bomb, should it have been planted.
